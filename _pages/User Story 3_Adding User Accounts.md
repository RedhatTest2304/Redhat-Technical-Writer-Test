## User Story 3: Adding User Accounts to ownCloud Server  

### Overview 
ownCloud is an enterprise file sharing service for online collaboration and storage. To access this service, the user needs to have their user account which is created and managed by the **admin group**.  

### Prerequisites for Adding User Accounts by the Admin Team
1.	Sign in to the _ownCloud server 10.1_ using an _administrator account_.

2.	Once the user administration page is displayed, click on the _username(admin)_.
        A drop-down menu appears with options to enter the following sections: **Personal**, **Users**, **Apps**, **Admin**, **Help**,           and **Log out**.

3.	Click on the **Users** item from the drop-down menu. A default table appears displaying basic information about the users whose         accounts have already been created.

4.	Create groups based on user’s access limitations.    
        To add groups, go to the **Groups** field. Hover over the **_+ add group field_**, enter a name for the group and hit the               **Enter** button.

	Now you can start adding users and adding them to specific groups as per defined access	controls.  
  
### Adding or Creating New User Accounts

  - Enter the new user’s **Login Name** and the initial **Password**  
  - (Optional) Assign **Groups** membership       
  - Click the **Create** button         

**Note**: Login names may contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), underscores (_), periods (.), and at signs (@). ownCloud usernames cannot be changed. These are user’s permanent-owned cloud user IDs. However, user’s **Full Name** can be changed. The admin can also edit the passwords and can change group assignments as and when needed. This is a useful mechanism for delegating some admin chores and also enabling groups to manage themselves.

After creating the user, you may fill in their **Full Name** if it is different from the login name or you can leave it for the user to complete.

**Note**: Press _Ctrl-R_ to refresh the page. This is done to make sure your new entry is visible.  

> To summarize, the steps involved in creating or adding a new user are entering a name and password and delegating the user to a group. The new user can now log in to the ownCloud server and start collaborating with other users.
